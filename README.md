# mintabline

Forked from [tabline.vim](https://github.com/kh3phr3n/tabline).

![mintabline](/../screenshots/preview.png?raw=true)

## Features

* Tab number: `¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹⁺` (you can use the number for `Ngt` movement)
* Filename: path shortened as in default tabline
* Modified flag instead of tab number: `*`
* New buffers are simply named as `∅` symbol (instead of ugly `[No name]`)

## Installation

To install this plugin, manually copy plugin/mintabline.vim to:

    ~/.vim/plugin/mintabline.vim

or instead, consider using a Vim plugin manager such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
